This repository contains a machine learning bioinformatics course by FreeCodeCamp.
If you want to replicate the study there is a complete course for free on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBlTQjcKuaY

In the course covid protein was changed to an acetylcolinestherase due to lack of information on that protein. 
But I took a diffrent approach.
Instead of swithing my pipeline to another biomolecule, I've stick to the original idea and run a Morgan Fingerprint analysis intead of a PubChem Fingerprint analysis.
I've also tested multiple machine larning models and fine-tuned the best one using PyCaret to get the best model possible for that drug-screening.

With love, 
Fernando.
